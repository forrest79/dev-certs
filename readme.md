## Documentation

To generate certificate just call `bin/generate-certificate output_directory domain1 [domain2] [domainX]`. For every domain is generated certificate for `domain` and `*.domain`.

`output_directory` is directory, where new certificates will be generated
`domain1` is main domain and certificates and keys are named by this domain (`domain1.crt`, `domain1.key` and `domain1.pem` are generated in `output_directory`)
`domain2` .. `domainX` are other domains to be included in certificate

**Example:**

I want to generate certificate for domains `forrest79.net.test` and `trmota.cz.test` (`.test` is recommendation from Google).

```bash
bin/generate-certificate /home/forrest79/certs forrest79.net.test trmota.cz.test
```

To proper use in your system is recommended to import `certs/rootCA-DEVCERT.crt` to certificate storage, after that, all generated certificates will be marked as trusted and you get "green" lock icon. Firefox has own certificates storage system, you must import this directly to Firefox to make generated certificates trusted.
